## Background
As a team of 4 students, we chose to help Shatterproof an organization aimed to turn the tide of the addiction crisis and to help every American with a substance use disorder to find treatment and lasting recovery. Their challenge was to find ways to facilitate and encourage activism and to reach out to more people. Our solution was to create an open discussion forum, an events page and a tracking system.
